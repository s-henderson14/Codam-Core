	+ Because the list size we work with will change depending on the input from the user, we must dynamically allocate memory for a list size accordingly.
		
		- Declare a struct for our list.

		- Declare a node as our list item.

		- Determine the size of the list input by the user.

		- Use malloc to allocate a space for input (list_size * sizeof(node-created)
